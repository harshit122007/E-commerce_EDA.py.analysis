# Project Title
 E-commerce_EDA.py.analysis

## 📖 Description
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce dataset to understand sales patterns, conversion rate , and highest / lowest revenue generated by cetogery
The analysis helps identify key business insights that can support data-driven decision-making.


## 🎯 Objective
this project showes:-
1) customer convertion rate (ex:- views < add to cart < place order )
2) top 5 categories
3) categories convertion rate (ex:- which categories convert more customers )
4) top 10 products convertion rate
5) finding of high price products (ex:-  * If a product has 200 views and 0 carts, its cart conversion = 0%
                                         * This is a strong signal of overpricing or mismatch between value and price.
                                         * Thus, products with high traffic but <1% view-to-cart conversion are likely overpriced.)
6) Create price buckets (* 1. HIGH PRICE & LOW CONVERSION → Overpriced
                         * 2. HIGH PRICE & HIGH CONVERSION → Premium & Healthy -- accepted price
                         * 3. LOW PRICE & HIGH CONVERSION → Strong Budget Category
                         * 4. LOW PRICE & LOW CONVERSION → Weak / Not Attractive )
7) top 10 categories which generate more revenue
8) top 10 categories which generate least revenue
9) AVG  order value of category
